# roop for StableDiffusion

This is an extension for StableDiffusion's [AUTOMATIC1111 web-ui](https://github.com/P2Enjoy/stable-diffusion-webui/) that allows face-replacement in images. It is based on [roop](https://github.com/s0md3v/roop) but will be developed seperately.

## Installation
First of all, if you can't install it for some reason, don't open an issue here. Google your errors.

To install the extension, follow these steps:

+ Run this command: `pip install insightface==0.7.3`
+ In web-ui, go to the "Extensions" tab and use this URL `https://github.com/s0md3v/sd-webui-roop` in the "install from URL" tab.
+ Close webui and run it again
+ If you encounter `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get'` error, download the [inswapper_128.onnx](https://huggingface.co/henryruhs/roop/resolve/main/inswapper_128.onnx) model and put it inside `<webui_dir>/models/roop/` directory.

On Windows.. just use linux: you're grown up enough to get to serious stuff instead of playing with baby's toys.
For rest of the errors, use google. Good luck.

## Usage

1. Under "roop" drop-down menu, import an image containing a face.
2. Turn on the "Enable" checkbox
3. That's it, now the generated result will have the face you selected

## Tips

### The result face is blurry
Use the "Restore Face" option. You can also try the "Upscaler" option or for more finer control, use an upscaler from the "Extras" tab.

### There are multiple faces in result
Select the face numbers you wish to swap using the "Comma separated face number(s)" option.

#### Getting good quality results
First of all, make sure the "Restore Face" option is enabled. You can also try the "Upscaler" option or for more finer control, use an upscaler from the "Extras" tab.

For even better quality, use img2img with denoise set to `0.1` and gradually increase it until you get a balance of quality and resembelance.

#### Replacing specific faces
If there are multiple faces in an image, select the face numbers you wish to swap using the "Comma separated face number(s)" option.

#### The face didn't get swapped?
Did you click "Enable"?

If you did and your console doesn't show any errors, it means roop detected that your image is either NSFW or wasn't able to detect a face at all.

### Img2Img

You can choose to activate the swap on the source image or on the generated image, or on both using the checkboxes. Activating on source image allows you to start from a given base and apply the diffusion process to it.

Inpainting should work but only the masked part will be swapped.
